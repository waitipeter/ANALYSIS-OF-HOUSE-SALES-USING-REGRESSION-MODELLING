# HOUSE SALES PREDICTION IN KING COUNTY USING REGRESSION MODELLING
    Project Overview 
For this project, I used regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

Assignment


ÔÅ∂	Business Problem: A real estate Agency need to provide prospective home sellers with guidance on how to improve the value of their home prior to listing, including the predicted increase in value expected based on improvements to particular features.



ÔÅ∂	Business Question: What features of their home can prospective home sellers change or improve to increase the value of their home, and by amount could this increase be specific to certain features?



## Requirements
This project requires that;

Your Jupyter Notebook should demonstrate an iterative approach to modeling. This means that you begin with a basic model, evaluate it, and then provide justification for and proceed to a new model. After you finish refining your models, you should provide 1-3 paragraphs discussing your final model - this should include interpreting at least 3 important parameter estimates or statistics.

Based on the results of your models, your notebook and presentation should discuss at least two features that have strong relationships with housing prices.

Your deliverables should explicitly address each step of the data science process. Refer to the Data Science Process lesson (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-data-science-processes.) from Topic 19 for more information about process models you can use.

## Data used
This project uses the King County House Sales dataset because Emerald City Realtors and its prospective homesellers are all based in King County. The dataset includes all data of single-family home sales from 2014-2015. The dataset itself can be found in kc_house_data.csv in the data folder of this GitHub repository along with the descriptions of the features, found in column_names.md Further information about the features can be found on the King County Assessor Website https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/esales/Glossary.aspx?type=r

             Column Names in the csv file and their descriptions.
    date - Date house was sold.
    price - Sale price (prediction target)
    bedrooms - Number of bedrooms
    bathrooms - Number of bathrooms
    sqft_living - Square footage of living space in the home
    sqft_lot - Square footage of the lot
    floors - Number of floors (levels) in house
    waterfront - Whether the house is on a waterfront
    view - Quality of view from house
    condition - How good the overall condition of the house is.
    grade - Overall grade of the house. 
    sqft_above - Square footage of house apart from basement
    sqft_basement - Square footage of the basement
    yr_built - Year when house was built
    yr_renovated - Year when house was renovated
